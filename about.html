        <p id="about">I am 24 years old, and I have been photographing sports since age 15. I attended Triton High School in Erwin, NC. At Triton, I was on the Yearbook Staff for four years and was named Photography Editor my senior year.
        <br/><br/>In high school, I spent much of my time on the sidelines of games, as a manager/bookkeeper for basketball and baseball and as a photographer for all sports. As a senior in high school, I was shooting sports photos for the Dunn Daily Record, a local newspaper.
        <br/><br/>I attended Appalachian State University for two years, during which time I photographed sports for ASU's Sports Information. I was also enrolled in the Photography program at Appalachian State.
        <br/><br/>My junior year in college, I transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I began studying Photojournalism. As a senior, I began a student internship in the Carolina Men's Basketball Office, where I continue to work today. I have photographed on the sidelines of many UNC athletic events, including Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Football, and Softball. In 2016, I was hired as the official photographer for the Roy Williams Basketball Camp.
        <br/><br/>Many photographs from all of these experiences can be found throughout the website, and all photographs are available for purchase. Please contact me if you have any questions about my photos or services.</p>
